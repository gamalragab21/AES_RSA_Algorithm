# Keystore with RSA and AES for Cryptographic Key Generation

## Description
This repository demonstrates how to use RSA and AES algorithms to create a secure keystore for generating and storing cryptographic keys. RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is used for secure key generation and key exchange, while AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is used for protecting the stored cryptographic keys.

## Introduction
In modern cryptographic systems, it is crucial to securely generate, store, and manage cryptographic keys. This repository demonstrates a two-step approach to achieve this. First, we use the RSA algorithm to generate a cryptographically secure key pair consisting of a public key and a private key. Then, we use the AES algorithm to encrypt and securely store the generated cryptographic key (or any sensitive data) in a keystore file.

## RSA Key Generation
The `generate_rsa_key_pair` function in the provided Python script generates an RSA key pair using the cryptography library. This key pair consists of a public key and a private key. The public key can be safely shared and used for encryption, while the private key should be kept secret and used for decryption.

## AES Key Storage
After generating the RSA key pair, the private key should be kept securely, possibly in a hardware security module (HSM) or a secure database. For the purpose of this demonstration, we'll create an AES key to encrypt the private key and store it in a keystore file. The `generate_aes_key` function generates a secure AES key using the PBKDF2HMAC algorithm and a strong password. The AES key is then used to encrypt the RSA private key before storing it in the keystore file.
